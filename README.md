### Hi there 😊

## I'm Marion from France! 

I'm interested in backend software development, I'm doing a little frontend too ✨

So far I've been working with these technologies :

  ✳️ Java/Spring Boot
  ✳️ ReactJs
  ✳️ Postgresql
  ✳️ HTML/CSS

I know a little about :

  ✴️ Python/Django
  ✴️ Docker

🔧 The tools I'm using :

Eclipse, VsCode, PgAdmin, Figma

⚗️ I'm currently working on :

- A website-style resume, to explain all my work experiences and what I've learned from them.
- Self-learning -> to continue my training in sofware development (how is Java working under the hood? also what are the basics of cybersecurity?).
